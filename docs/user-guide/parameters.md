# Parameters

This page explains the training controls on `CartoBoostRegressor` and how they
change fitting behavior. Start with defaults, establish a validation split,
and tune only parameters that correspond to the structure in your data.

## Choose Parameters From The Data

Before tuning ranges, decide what claim the model needs to support. In
structured regression work, parameters should usually map to a modeling
question:

| Scientific question | Controls to consider |
| --- | --- |
| Is a dense tabular baseline enough for fare, duration, demand, or residual prediction? | `split_policy=SplitPolicy.AXIS_ONLY` |
| Are pickup/dropoff coordinates or projected x/y values defining spatial boundaries? | `SplitPolicy.STRUCTURED` plus declared spatial-pair schema entries |
| Does hour-of-day, weekday, or season wrap around? | `SplitPolicy.STRUCTURED` plus declared periodic schema entries |
| Are rare memberships, routes, cells, or service-area memberships part of the signal? | `SplitPolicy.STRUCTURED` plus declared sparse-set schema entries |
| Should nearby observations blend across an uncertain boundary? | `fuzzy=True`, `fuzzy_bandwidth`, `fuzzy_kernel` |
| Is the target about median-like behavior, outlier resistance, or asymmetric service risk? | `loss="mae"`, `loss="huber"`, `loss="log_l2"`, or `loss="quantile"` |
| Is a local trend still visible after the tree finds a region or time bucket? | `leaf_predictor="linear"`, `linear_leaf_features` |
| Does domain knowledge require monotone response to a dense feature? | `monotonic_constraints` |

Keep comparisons disciplined: change one family of modeling controls at a time
when possible, and compare against an axis-only CartoBoost baseline plus
LightGBM or XGBoost under the same split and feature set.

## Core Boosting

These parameters control model capacity and shrinkage. They are useful for
ordinary bias/variance tuning after the validation split is fixed.

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `n_estimators` | `100` | Number of boosting rounds. Must be non-negative. |
| `learning_rate` | `0.05` | Shrinks each tree contribution. Must be finite and positive. |
| `max_depth` | `4` | Maximum tree depth. `0` produces a constant model. |
| `min_samples_leaf` | `20` | Minimum weighted row count per leaf candidate. |
| `min_gain` | `1e-8` | Minimum gain required to split. |
| `random_state` | `None` | Reserved for deterministic APIs; current training paths are deterministic. |
| `n_threads` | `None` | Number of native CPU threads; use it for reproducible scale measurements. |

## Bounding expensive split searches

`CartoBoostRegressor` and `CartoBoostClassifier` accept
`max_split_candidates=None` (default) or a positive integer such as `32`.
The limit applies per node and dense feature, spatial projection, Gaussian
center, or periodic feature to candidates that require direct row-by-row
loss evaluation. Efficient prefix-sum searches and sparse-set searches retain
their existing candidate sets.

Candidates are selected deterministically across the ordered candidate range.
This can reduce training cost with robust losses or fuzzy routing without
changing the loss or routing formulas. It can change the selected trees:
compare held-out accuracy and runtime before choosing a budget. `None`
preserves exhaustive direct searches. Native JSON save/load retains the budget.

## Loss

Choose the loss from the estimand. Mean regression is appropriate for many
fare or duration targets, but structured data often contains heavy tails,
dispatch exceptions, and localized service-level questions.

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `loss` | `"l2"` | Accepts `"l2"`, `"squared_error"`, `"l1"`, `"mae"`, `"absolute_error"`, `"huber"`, `"log_l2"`, `"quantile"`, or `"pinball"`. |
| `quantile_alpha` | `0.5` | Required to be finite and in `(0, 1)` for quantile loss. |
| `huber_delta` | `1.0` | Positive clipping threshold for Huber loss. |
| `log_offset` | `1.0` | Positive offset for `log_l2`. |

`l1`, `huber`, `log_l2`, and quantile loss currently require
`leaf_predictor="constant"`.

## Split policy

`SplitPolicy` is the main CartoBoost structural modeling choice. `AUTO` lets
Rust choose the bounded dense path, `AXIS_ONLY` keeps the baseline exact, and
`STRUCTURED` derives candidates only from declared schema roles.

| Policy | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SplitPolicy.AUTO` | Bounded native dense search selected from fit shape and objective. |
| `SplitPolicy.AXIS_ONLY` | Standard one-feature threshold baseline. |
| `SplitPolicy.STRUCTURED` | Native candidates derived only from periodic, spatial-pair, and sparse-set schema roles. |

Common temporal-spatial policies:

| Problem shape | Suggested policy |
| --- | --- |
| General tabular baseline | `SplitPolicy.AUTO` |
| Exact axis baseline | `SplitPolicy.AXIS_ONLY` |
| Dense location and time | `SplitPolicy.STRUCTURED` with declared roles |
| Route or cell membership | `SplitPolicy.STRUCTURED` with periodic and sparse roles |
| Location plus sparse memberships | `SplitPolicy.STRUCTURED` with spatial-pair and sparse roles |

## Leaves

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `leaf_predictor` | `"constant"` | Accepts `"constant"` or `"linear"`. |
| `linear_leaf_features` | `None` | Python API currently expects stringified integer feature indices, such as `["0", "2"]`. |
| `l2_regularization` | `1.0` | Ridge penalty for linear leaves. |

Use linear leaves when the tree can find a region or time bucket but the
remaining residual trend inside that region is still approximately linear. For
example, a learned corridor may still have a distance or time-of-day trend
represented locally rather than globally.

## Fuzzy Routing

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fuzzy` | `False` | Enables fractional branch assignment during training and weighted prediction recursion. |
| `fuzzy_bandwidth` | `0.0` | Split transition bandwidth. Must be finite and non-negative. |
| `fuzzy_kernel` | `"linear"` | Transition shape. Accepts `"linear"`, `"gaussian"`, `"exponential"`, `"bisquare"`, `"epanechnikov"`, or `"tricube"`. |

Fuzzy routing is not compatible with monotonic constraints.

Use fuzzy routing for temporal-spatial features where nearby values should not
change abruptly at a learned boundary. This is especially relevant when zone
edges, corridor definitions, pickup coordinates, or service areas are noisy
measurements of a continuous process. Set `fuzzy_bandwidth` in the same units
as the feature values, such as projected coordinate units or hours. Use
`fuzzy_kernel="linear"` for simple piecewise interpolation, `"gaussian"` or
`"tricube"` for smoother transitions, and compact-support kernels like
`"bisquare"` or `"epanechnikov"` when you want the blend to drop off faster
near the edge of the band.

## Monotonic Constraints

`monotonic_constraints` is a list of `-1`, `0`, or `1` values with one entry per
dense feature:

- `1` requires predictions to be non-decreasing in that feature.
- `-1` requires predictions to be non-increasing in that feature.
- `0` leaves the feature unconstrained.

Current constraints require constant leaves, non-fuzzy training, and axis-style
split policy. Use `SplitPolicy.STRUCTURED` when the scientific design requires directional behavior,
such as non-decreasing fare with distance after accounting for the rest of the
feature set, and document that constraint in the model artifact or report.
